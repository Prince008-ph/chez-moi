            <h1>Welcome to our site! We rank the best Hot Wheels.</h1>
            <p>Founded in 2017 by Valnet Inc.,</p>
            
                <p>Epic Hot Wheels is a ranking-item site with a different spin on things, and we break some of the biggest stories around.
                 We wrote an extensive expose on workplace abuse at Techland, an oral history on Dragon Age: Origins, and we were the first to report that PlayStation was moving to shut the Vita store down.
                  For all your news, views, and reviews, (and guides, but that doesnâ€™t rhyme), you should bookmark Epic Hot Wheels. 

                Epic Hot Wheels is a regular attendee at events like PAX, EGX, the BAFTAs, Gamescom (including the Asia and LATAM events), and Summer Game Fest, and has served on the jury at The Game Awards - we voted for the good games. 
                Owned and operated by Valnet Inc.
                 Since its inception, Epic Hot Wheels is a MCV/Develop award nominee for Best Media Brand and its staff have been named on MCV's 30 under 30, as well as being nominated for the GameHers Award for Journalism and GGE Feature Writer of the Year, while Editor-in-Chief Stacey Henley won the GGE for Best Feature in 2020.
